I’m a computer science student and software engineer with a background shaped by living across three continents. Born in Warri, Nigeria, I spent my early years in West Africa before moving to Saudi Arabia and later settling in Houston, Texas. Growing up across different cultures taught me adaptability, curiosity, and how to approach problems from multiple perspectives.

I’m currently studying Computer Science at the University of Houston, where I focus on building practical, scalable software systems that bridge engineering, data, and real-world impact.

Education & Technical Journey
======
My academic path reflects a deliberate shift toward hands-on problem solving. I began my university studies at the University of Texas at Austin in Electrical and Computer Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in systems thinking and mathematics. I later transferred to Houston Community College to pivot fully into Computer Science, and I’m now continuing that journey at the University of Houston, with an expected graduation in Fall 2026.

Along the way, I’ve complemented coursework with industry experience and personal projects, working across frontend, backend, cloud infrastructure, and data systems. I’m especially interested in building software that handles real data at scale and connects cleanly with external systems.

Current Employment
======
I am currently a Software Engineer (Part-Time) at [Whitson](https://whitson.com/), working on the Data Integration team. I design and maintain external API endpoints and data pipelines that support importing and exporting data between the platform and external systems.

My role involves full-stack development using modern frontend and backend tools, collaborating in cloud-based environments, and deploying services in production. I also support ongoing feature development, bug fixes, and mentor new interns as they onboard into the engineering team.

Personal Interests
======
Outside of software, I value staying active and balanced. I enjoy working out, running, and playing sports, especially basketball. Music is another creative outlet for me, and I play both guitar and bass guitar. These interests help me stay disciplined, creative, and focused, qualities I bring into my work as an engineer.

I’m always learning, whether that’s through code, collaboration, or new environments, and I enjoy working with people who are curious, thoughtful, and driven to build meaningful things.
